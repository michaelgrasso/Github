abstract = {A method is described for producing focused intracochlear electric stimulation using an array of N electrodes. For each electrode site, N weights are computed that define the ratios of positive and negative electrode currents required to produce cancellation of the voltage within scala tympani at all of the N-1 other sites. Multiple sites can be stimulated simultaneously by superposition of their respective current vectors. The method allows N independent stimulus waveforms to be delivered to each of the N electrode sites without spatial overlap. Channel interaction from current spread associated with monopolar stimulation is substantially eliminated. The method operates by inverting the spread functions of individual monopoles as measured with the other electrodes. The method was implemented and validated with data from three human subjects implanted with 22-electrode perimodiolar arrays. Results indicate that (1) focusing is realizable with realistic precision; (2) focusing comes at the cost of increased total stimulation current; (3) uncanceled voltages that arise beyond the ends of the array are weak except when stimulating the two end channels; and (4) close perimodiolar positioning of the electrodes may be important for minimizing stimulation current and sensitivity to measurement errors.},

abstract = {The multichannel design of contemporary cochlear implants (CIs) is predicated on the assumption that each channel activates a relatively restricted and independent sector of the deaf auditory nerve array, just as a sound within a restricted frequency band activates a restricted region of the normal cochlea The independence of CI channels, however, is limited; and the factors that determine their independence, the relative overlap of the activity patterns that they evoke, are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the spread of activity evoked by cochlear implant channels by monitoring activity at 16 sites along the tonotopic axis of the guinea pig inferior colliculus (IC). "Spatial tuning curves" (STCs) measured in this way serve as an estimate of activation spread within the cochlea and the ascending auditory pathways. We contrast natural stimulation using acoustic tones with two kinds of electrical stimulation either (1) a loose fitting banded array consisting of a cylindrical silicone elastomer carrier with a linear series of ring contacts; or (2) a space-filling array consisting of a tapered silicone elastomer carrier that is designed to fit snugly into the guinea pig scala tympani with a linear series of ball contacts positioned along it Spatial tuning curves evoked by individual acoustic tones, and by activation of each contact of each array as a monopole, bipole or tripole were recorded. Several channel configurations and a wide range of electrode separations were tested for each array, and their thresholds and selectivity were estimated. The results indicate that the tapered space-filling arrays evoked more restricted activity patterns at lower thresholds than did the banded arrays. Monopolar stimulation (one intracochlear contact activated with an extracochlear return) using either array evoked broad activation patterns that involved the entire recording array at current levels {\textless}6 dB SL, but at relatively low thresholds. Bi- and tri-polar configurations of both array types evoked more restricted activity patterns, but their thresholds were higher than those of monopolar configurations. Bipolar and tripolar configurations with closely spaced contacts evoked activity patterns that were comparable to those evoked by pure tones. As the spacing of bipolar electrodes was increased (separations {\textgreater}1 mm), the activity patterns became broader and evoked patterns with two distinct threshold minima, one associated with each contact.},

@article{Smith2013,
abstract = {Cochlear implants are highly successful neural prostheses that restore hearing in the deaf, often resulting in high levels of speech understanding in quiet listening conditions. In more challenging conditions, however, cochlear implant subjects often score much lower than their normal-hearing peers, possibly reflecting limits of the electrode-neural interface. In this study, we compare monopolar stimulation versus focused stimulation, using multipolar channels, to test if current focusing can increase spectral resolution. Psychophysical results show that current focusing significantly improves subjects' ability to discriminate spectral features and detect dynamic modulations in sound stimuli. These results suggest that focused stimulation can successfully increase the number of effective channels with a cochlear implant and may lead to improved hearing in noisy conditions.},

abstract = {Speech recognition by normal-hearing listeners improves as a function of the number of spectral channels when tested with a noiseband vocoder simulating cochlear implant signal processing. Speech recognition by the best cochlear implant users, however, saturates around eight channels and does not improve when more electrodes are activated, presumably due to reduced frequency selectivity caused by channel interactions. Listeners with sensorineural hearing loss may also have reduced frequency selectivity due to cochlear damage and the resulting reduction in the nonlinear cochlear mechanisms. The present study investigates whether such a limitation in spectral information transmission would be observed with hearing-impaired listeners, similar to implant users. To test the hypothesis, hearing-impaired subjects were selected from a population of patients with moderate hearing loss of cochlear origin, where the frequency selectivity would be expected to be poorer compared to normal hearing. Hearing-impaired subjects were tested for vowel and consonant recognition in steady-state background noise of varying levels using a noiseband vocoder and as a function of the number of spectral channels. For comparison, normal-hearing subjects were tested with the same stimuli at different presentation levels. In quiet and low background noise, performance by normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects was similar. In higher background noise, performance by hearing-impaired subjects saturated around eight channels, while performance by normal-hearing subjects continued to increase up to 12-16 channels with vowels, and 10-12 channels with consonants. A similar trend was observed for most of the presentation levels at which the normal-hearing subjects were tested. Therefore, it is unlikely that the effects observed with hearing-impaired subjects were due to insufficient audibility or high presentation levels. Consequently, the results with hearing-impaired subjects were similar to previous results obtained with implant users, but only for background noise conditions.},

@article{Marozeau2015,
abstract = {In today's cochlear implant (CI) systems, the monopolar (MP) electrode configuration is the most commonly used stimulation mode, requiring only a single current source. However, with an implant that will allow simultaneous activation of multiple independent current sources, it is possible to implement an all-polar (AP) stimulation mode designed to create a focused electrical field. The goal of this experiment was to study the potential benefits of this all-polar mode for reducing uncontrolled electrode interactions compared with the monopolar mode. The five participants who took part in the study were implanted with a research device that was connected via a percutaneous connector to a benchtop stimulator providing 22 independent current sources. The perceptual effects of the AP mode were tested in three experiments. In Experiment 1, the current level difference between loudness-matched sequential and simultaneous stimuli composed of 2 spatially separated pulse trains was measured as function of the electrode separation. Results indicated a strong current-summation interaction for simultaneous stimuli in the MP mode for separations up to at least 4.8 mm. No significant interaction was found in the AP mode beyond a separation of 2.4 mm. In Experiment 2, a forward-masking paradigm was used with fixed equally loud probes in AP and MP modes, and AP maskers presented on different electrode positions. Results indicated a similar spatial masking pattern between modes. In Experiment 3, subjects were asked to discriminate between across-electrode temporal delays. It was hypothesized that discrimination would decrease with electrode separation faster in AP compared to MP modes. However, results showed no difference between the two modes. Overall, the results indicated that the AP mode produced less current spread than MP mode but did not lead to a significant advantage in terms of spread of neuronal excitation at equally loud levels.},
