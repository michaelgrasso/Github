\begin_layout Standard
Sound undergoes a series of transformations as it travels though the human
 ear, consisting of the outer, middle and inner ear then through the auditory
 nerve and into the brain.
 The outer ear captures acoustic pressure waves which are subsequently converted
 to mechanical vibrations via the middle ear.
 Once passing through to the inner the, the cochlea, a snail-shaped cavity
 filled with fluid, transforms these vibrations in such a way that it leads
 to the displacement of the basilar membrane.
 Attached to this membrane are hair cells that are bent according to the
 respective change in displacement of the membrane, causing a release in
 an electrochemical substance causing neurons to fire, signaling the excitation
 of a particular section of the inner ear.
 Thus, these neurons communicate with systems in the brain and transmit
 the acoustic signal information
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "PhiliposC.Loizou1998"

\end_inset

.
 If these hair cells are damaged, the auditory system has no way of transforming
 the acoustic pressure to neural impulses, leading to a hearing impairment.
 However, the neurons can still be excited directly through electrical stimulati
on, thus a purpose for the Cochlear Implant.

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple cochlear implants have been developed over the years with all implant
 devices having the following features: a microphone to capture sound, a
 signal processor to convert the sound into electrical signals, a transmission
 system that transmits these signals to the electrode array inserted inside
 the cochlea 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The electrodes can be stimulated in many ways, some are outlined in this
 review.

\begin_layout Subsection
Monopolar Stimulation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In today's cochlear implant (CI) systems, monopolar (MP) electrode stimulation
 is predominantly used.
 In this method of stimulation, current flows between an intra-cochlear
 electrode (ICE), known as the active electrode and one or more extra-cochlear
 electrodes (ECE), known as the reference electrode.
 In monopolar stimulation mode, channels are defined respectively to the
 active electrode.
 Thus, 
\emph on
channel one
\emph default
 is defined as the first electrode in the array.
 When applying stimulation to this channel, this means applying a current
 between the first electrode and its corresponding reference electrode 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Swanson2013"

\end_inset

.
 In challenging situations, such as listening to a talker in the presence
 of multiple competing voices, there can be large performance gaps between
 CI and normal acoustic hearing.
 It has previously been demonstrated that the speech understanding with
 a CI improves with an increasing number of electrodes until approximately
 7-8, where speech-in-noise performance saturates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Baskent2006"

\end_inset

.
 A potential cause of the saturation in CI speech-in-noise performance at
 this electrode number, may be the spread of excitation from the relatively
 broad current flow produced by the monopolar stimulation modes used in
 clinical CIs.
 This current spread may lead to large overlaps in the neural excitation
 patterns elicted by nearby electrodes, limiting the number of effective
 channels and spectral resolution.
 Reducing the spread of excitation is advantageous as it reduces interference
 with other channels.

\begin_layout Subsection
Multipolar Stimulation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multipolar stimulation, also referred to as phased array stimulation or
 all-polar (AP) stimulation uses most, if not all, of the electrodes in
 the array to deliver stimulation to the recipients cochlea incorporating
 an optimised weighting unit to minimize simultaneous channel interactions.
 In this mode, each channel calls for electric current to be applied to
 one of the active electrodes in varying proportions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Swanson2013"

\end_inset

.A main limitation of the CI is the spread of current induced by each intra-cochl
ear electrode: thus each electrode may activate an inappropriately large
 range of sensory neurons, cause uncontrolled loudness and spectral shape
 distortions.
 This limits the ability to simultaneously present spectral or temporal
 information at more than once cochlear site
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Marozeau2015"

\end_inset

.Thus, multipolar stimulation is advantageous due to that it incorporates
 multiple current sources which could potentially reduce the spread of excitatio
n.

Spectral Resolution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Psychophysical results show that current focusing significantly improves
 subjects' ability to discriminate spectral features, suggesting that focused
 multipolar stimulation can increase the number of effective channels with
 a cochlear implant.
 A study was conducted that compared monopolar stimulation versus focused
 stimulation, using multipolar channels, to test if current focusing can
 increase spectral resolution.
 In this study, two experiments were conducted to provide information on
 the comparison on these two channel configurations.
 The first experiment involved spectral ripple stimuli used to measure spectral
 ripple phase discrimination thresholds.
 These stimuli had a bandwidth ranging between (120-7680 Hz), covering the
 full input frequency range of CI processing.
 Four ripple densities were tested: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 cycles/octave.
 The second experiment involved, dynamic ripple stimuli being used to measure
 spectrotemporal modulation

 Stimulation levels for the different CI maps were set for each channel
 configuration separately, mapped to the appropriate threshold (T) current
 levels and comfort (C) current levels.
 For analysis, modulation depth is 0 dB for a fully modulated signal and
 increasingly negative for smaller modulations.

\begin_layout Section
Electrode Weighting Unit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In current hearing protheses, the command module determines the magnitudes
 of current to apply to each respective electrode in order to achieve appropriat
e stimulation on the channel.
 This results in the command module transmitting a data word for each electrode
 array during multipolar stimulation, which potentially reduces the number
 of individual applications of current to a channel per unit of time; known
 as a pulse rate.
 A recent US Patent Application by inventor Brett Swanson of Cochlear Limited
 outlines a system and method of performing a weighting operation inside
 the stimulation module of a stimulation prosthesis, which ameliorates this
 problem.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In accordance with this embodiment, a stimulation module includes a receiver
 that is configured for receiving stimulation data transmitted by the command
 module which includes a channel and amplitude value.
 It also includes weighting unit configured for calculating, based on the
 channel and amplitude value, a set of magnitudes and an arrangement of
 current-sources and switches configured for applying current to the array
 of electrodes based on the calculated set of magnitudes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Swanson2013"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, the stimulation module determines the individual electrodes and magnitude
s of current to apply to each respective channel, thereby reducing the amount
 of data transmitted between the command and stimulation module per pulse,
 allowing for higher pulse rates.

, is a simulation prothesis including the command and stimulation module.
 A typical command module includes such components as a processor, memory
 storage, and a RF interface.
 In this review, the focus command module of a cochlear implant system also
 contains at least one microphone to process an audio signal, working in
 conjunction with a particular sound coding strategy.
 In the cochlear implant system, the command module transmits information
 of a serial RF inductive data link, which in some cases also provides power
 to the stimulation module.
